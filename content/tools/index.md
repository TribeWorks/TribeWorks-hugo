-   Use latest version of Python if possible.

-   Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

-   [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for standardized code formatting.

-   Conform to coding standards via automated tools such as
    [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). See
    [Python Code Quality](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/).

-   Use Python type declarations, and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.

-   We are experimenting with [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/) for assisted
    code refactoring.

-   Automatic generation of documentation, so that the docstrings can
    be the single source of truth (and thus better maintained).

-   Cookiecutter for creating projects.
