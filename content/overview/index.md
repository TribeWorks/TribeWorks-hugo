## Mission

-   Get rid of things that don't produce software

## What We Are

-   We create software to meet your needs.

-   An experimentally-oriented software development consultancy started
    by [Bruce Eckel](https://www.mindviewllc.com/).

-   A flat organization following the [Teal
    model](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/uploads/2/1/9/8/21988088/140305_laloux_reinventing_organizations.pdf)

## Our Core Experiment

-   Maximize programmer happiness (From
    [Dan Pink's "Drive"](https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc): Autonomy,
    Mastery & Purpose). We think this produces much better software and
    higher per-hour productivity.

## Testimonials

### Pando Telecom

"We wanted to stand up a project very quickly but also wanted to create a
project that used relevant libraries within the Python arena. The goal of the
project was to create a system that could monitor our IOT devices. With
multiple manufacturers used in the network, we wanted to create a system that
provided a common user interface to manage and track these IOT devices.

"The TribeWorks Team made it really easy for us to stand up our application. We
provided our specs and criteria. TribeWorks provided the code and backend
functionality. Our favorite part of working with TribeWorks was the blocks of
time we could secure and get from coders. The no frills approach and
flexibility worked for our teams."
