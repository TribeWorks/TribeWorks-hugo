## What We Are

-   An experimentally-oriented software development consultancy started
    by [Bruce Eckel](https://www.mindviewllc.com/).

-   A flat organization following the [Teal
    model](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/uploads/2/1/9/8/21988088/140305_laloux_reinventing_organizations.pdf)

## Our Core Experiment

-   Maximize programmer happiness (From
    [Dan Pink's "Drive"](https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc): Autonomy,
    Mastery & Purpose). We think this produces much better software and
    higher per-hour productivity.
