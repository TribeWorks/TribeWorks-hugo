## What We Are

-   An experimentally-oriented software development consultancy started
    by [Bruce Eckel](https://www.mindviewllc.com/).

-   A flat organization following the [Teal
    model](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/uploads/2/1/9/8/21988088/140305_laloux_reinventing_organizations.pdf)

## Our Core Experiment

-   Maximize programmer happiness (From
    [Dan Pink's "Drive"](https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc): Autonomy,
    Mastery & Purpose). We think this produces much better software and
    higher per-hour productivity.

## How We Work

-   Get rid of everything that doesn't produce software:

    -   Agile-ish: we keep the things that produce software

    -   Commuting doesn't produce software: Programmers are fully
        remote, and meet using internet tools.

    -   We are part of the no-estimate movement. You can always look to
        see how fast things have been moving.

-   Get rid of any friction that slows down development.

-   Programmers decide on a daily basis how much they work (Autonomy).
    There is no emphasis on "putting in the hours," as we believe that
    degrades quality. Programmers don't push past the point of
    diminishing returns---they only work when they can be actively
    engaged and enthusiastic about your project.

-   We do whatever we can to mitigate urgency. Living with urgency
    degrades the quality of life, so we think it probably degrades the
    quality of software as well.

-   Software development is a pure knowledge-based profession. The
    smarter our programmers are, the more you benefit. We invest to
    increase expertise.

-   Maximal transparency: we use tools that allow everyone to see
    what's happening at all times. This eliminates the need for status
    meetings.

-   We make decisions based on evidence and direct experience and
    experiments. We minimize what-if thinking.

## Tools and Process

-   Extensive use of Github: You own the Github repo, and the repo is
    your deliverable. You have access to the current state of the repo
    at all times. If you decide that the project is finished or that
    you'd like to work with a different company, the change requires
    minimal effort because you have all artifacts from the project.

-   We use Github projects to show what is on the task list, what's
    currently being worked on, and what is finished, so you can see
    what's in process at any time.

-   Status meetings are unnecessary. There are no regular scheduled
    meetings, and meetings are only held to understand new feature
    requests or address problems.

-   Meetings can be requested by either customer or programmer, as
    needed.

-   You pay hourly for programmer time + organizational overhead. Time
    for each programmer is kept on Google spreadsheets which you have
    access to. Billing is monthly.

## Technologies

-   We seek Python projects.

-   We've been using Vue.js for the front end and Django for
    microservices, deploying to the Google cloud.

-   We're happy to learn any technology if you're willing to pay for
    the time.

## Preferences

-   Use latest version of Python if possible.

-   Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

-   [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for standardized code formatting.

-   Conform to coding standards via automated tools such as
    [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). See
    [Python Code Quality](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/).

-   Use Python type declarations, and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.

-   We are experimenting with [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/) for assisted
    code refactoring.

-   Automatic generation of documentation, so that the docstrings can
    be the single source of truth (and thus better maintained).

-   Cookiecutter for creating projects.
