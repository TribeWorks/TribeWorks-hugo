##   People before profits

Yes, we need to make a profit, but we're in business to create value for
everyone, including the people who work here. Money is only a small part of
that value.

##   Get rid of things that don't produce software

-   Agile-ish: we keep the things that produce software.

-   Agile acknowledges that you can only measure how fast you're moving in the
    moment, but you can't decide how long something will take. If you have
    fixed deadlines, we're not the right fit for your needs.

-   Commuting doesn't produce software: Programmers are fully
    remote, and meet using internet tools.

-   We are part of the
    [no-estimate movement](https://www.geepawhill.org/2017/07/15/estimating-stop-trying-harder/).
    You can always look to see how fast things have been moving.

-   Remove friction that slows down development.

## Autonomy

Programmers decide on a daily basis how much they work.
There is no emphasis on "putting in the hours," as we believe that
degrades quality. Programmers don't push past the point of
diminishing returns---they only work when they can be actively
engaged and enthusiastic about your project. This produces more value
for your money.

## Reduce Urgency

We do whatever we can to mitigate urgency. Living with urgency degrades the
quality of life, so we think it probably degrades the quality of software as
well.

## Increase Knowledge

Software development is a pure knowledge-based profession. The smarter our
programmers are, the more you benefit. We invest to increase expertise.

## Maximal Transparency

We use tools that allow everyone to see what's happening at all times. This
eliminates the need for status meetings.

## Evidence-Based Thinking

We make decisions based on evidence and direct experience and experiments. We
minimize what-if thinking.
