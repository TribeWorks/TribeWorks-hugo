##   People before profits

Yes, we need to make a profit, but we're in business to create value for
everyone, including the people who work here. Money is only a small part of
that value.

##   Get rid of things that don't produce software

-   Agile-ish: we keep the things that produce software.

-   Commuting doesn't produce software: Programmers are fully
    remote, and meet using internet tools.

-   We are part of the
    [no-estimate movement](https://www.geepawhill.org/2017/07/15/estimating-stop-trying-harder/).
    You can always look to see how fast things have been moving.

-   Remove friction that slows down development.

## Autonomy

Programmers decide on a daily basis how much they work.
There is no emphasis on "putting in the hours," as we believe that
degrades quality. Programmers don't push past the point of
diminishing returns---they only work when they can be actively
engaged and enthusiastic about your project. This produces more value
for your money.

## Reduce Urgency

We do whatever we can to mitigate urgency. Living with urgency degrades the
quality of life, so we think it probably degrades the quality of software as
well.

## Increase Knowledge

Software development is a pure knowledge-based profession. The smarter our
programmers are, the more you benefit. We invest to increase expertise.

## Maximal Transparency

We use tools that allow everyone to see what's happening at all times. This
eliminates the need for status meetings.

## Evidence-Based Thinking

We make decisions based on evidence and direct experience and experiments. We
minimize what-if thinking.
