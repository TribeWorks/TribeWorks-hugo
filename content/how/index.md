-   Get rid of things that don't produce software.

    -   Agile-ish: we keep the things that produce software

    -   Commuting doesn't produce software: Programmers are fully
        remote, and meet using internet tools.

    -   We are part of the no-estimate movement. You can always look to
        see how fast things have been moving.

-   Remove friction that slows down development.

-   Programmers decide on a daily basis how much they work (Autonomy).
    There is no emphasis on "putting in the hours," as we believe that
    degrades quality. Programmers don't push past the point of
    diminishing returns---they only work when they can be actively
    engaged and enthusiastic about your project.

-   We do whatever we can to mitigate urgency. Living with urgency
    degrades the quality of life, so we think it probably degrades the
    quality of software as well.

-   Software development is a pure knowledge-based profession. The
    smarter our programmers are, the more you benefit. We invest to
    increase expertise.

-   Maximal transparency: we use tools that allow everyone to see
    what's happening at all times. This eliminates the need for status
    meetings.

-   We make decisions based on evidence and direct experience and
    experiments. We minimize what-if thinking.
