We seek Python projects.

We are happy to learn other technologies.

## The Technology Stack We've Been Using

### Google Cloud Platform

  - App Engine
  - Cloud SQL

### Docker

  - Containerized Solutions for Cloud Run
  - Custom Runtimes for App Engine

### Django Rest Framework

  - Creating APIs

### Github & Github Actions

  - Version control
  - Continuous Integration
  - Automated testing

### Nuxt

  - Connecting APIs to User Interfaces

### Vue.js

  - Creating beautiful frontends

## Tools

-   Latest Python version (if possible).

-   Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

-   [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for standardized code formatting.

-   Conform to coding standards via automated tools such as
    [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). See
    [Python Code Quality](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/).

-   [Style and coding tips](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)

-   Use Python type declarations, and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.

-   Use docstrings for automatic generation of documentation, so the docstrings
    are the single source of truth.

-   [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for creating projects.

-   We are experimenting with [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/) for assisted
    code refactoring.
