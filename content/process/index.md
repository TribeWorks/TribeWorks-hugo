-   Extensive use of Github: You own the Github repo, and the repo is
    your deliverable. You have access to the current state of the repo
    at all times. If you decide that the project is finished or that
    you'd like to work with a different company, the change requires
    minimal effort because you have all artifacts from the project.

-   We use Github projects to show what is on the task list, what's
    currently being worked on, and what is finished, so you can see
    what's in process at any time.

-   Status meetings are unnecessary. There are no regular scheduled
    meetings, and meetings are only held to understand new feature
    requests or address problems.

-   Meetings can be requested by either customer or programmer, as
    needed.

-   You pay hourly for programmer time + organizational overhead. Time
    for each programmer is kept on Google spreadsheets which you have
    access to. Billing is monthly.
