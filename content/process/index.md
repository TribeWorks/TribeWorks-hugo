-   Extensive use of Github: You own the Github repo, and the repo is
    your deliverable. You have access to the current state of the repo
    at all times. If you decide that the project is finished or that
    you'd like to work with a different company, the change requires
    minimal effort because you have all artifacts from the project.

-   We use Github projects to show what is on the task list, what's
    currently being worked on, and what is finished, so you can see
    what's in process at any time.

-   We focus on quality rather than speed of development. If you have
    fixed deadlines, we're not the right fit for your needs.

-   Status meetings are unnecessary, so we don't waste your money on them.
    There are no regular scheduled meetings, and meetings are only held to
    understand new feature requests or address problems.

-   Meetings (online) can be requested by either customer or programmer, as
    needed.

## Fees

-   To initiate a project we charge an up-front retainer that pays for initial
    exploration of that project. We investigate and report back to you what
    we find so you can decide whether to continue. It's possible that the retainer
    may produce some working code for your project, but the objective is simply
    discovery.

-   You pay hourly for programmer time + organizational overhead. Time
    for each programmer is kept on Google spreadsheets which you have
    access to. Billing is monthly.
